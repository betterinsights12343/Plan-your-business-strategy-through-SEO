Digital marketing vs. SEO
SEO is one of many different strategies and tactics used in digital marketing. Instead, SEO is only a part of digital marketing. Additionally, digital marketing has a larger reach than SEO because it consists of many different elements, one of which being SEO itself. Social media marketing, YouTube video promotion, advertisements, SEO, and other elements of digital marketing are possible. SEO is a digital marketing strategy in and of itself that can raise a website's rating. Additionally, although experts in digital marketing may be knowledgeable in all facets of it, it's not always the case that SEO experts can manage other facets of it.
